/*
 * The values for the "tval" field of various objects.
 *
 * This value is the primary means by which items are sorted in the
 * player inventory_list, followed by "sval" and "cost".
 *
 * Note that a "BOW" with tval = 19 and sval S = 10*N+P takes a missile
 * weapon with tval = 16+N, and does (xP) damage when so combined.  This
 * fact is not actually used in the source, but it kind of interesting.
 *
 * Note that as of 2.7.8, the "item flags" apply to all items, though
 * only armor and weapons and a few other items use any of these flags.
